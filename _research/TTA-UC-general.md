Photon upconversion (UC) via the mechanism of triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) can be performed with high efficiency under excitation with low-cost light-emitting diodes or laser sources of moderate excitation intensity. As illustrated in figure above, a typical TTA-UC system combines two components: a sensitizer and an emitter, undergoing a series of energy transfer processes. Photon energy absorbed by the sensitizer is stored in its triplet state, formed via the process of intersystem crossing (ISC). Further, this energy is transferred to an emitter triplet state in a process of triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET). Next, the excited triplet states of two emitter molecules undergo triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA), in which one emitter molecule returns back to its singlet ground state and the other molecule gains the energy of both triplet states and is excited to a higher energy singlet state. As the singlet state of rubrene decays radiatively back to the ground state, a fluorescence photon is emitted which is strongly blue-shifted compared to the excitation photons.

Using this unique feature, TTA-UC has found various applications such as photocatalysis, bioimaging, photomedicine and solar energy conversion. Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit (SQ limit) of the maximum theoretical efficiency of a semiconductor solar cell places maximum energy conversion efficiency around 33.7% (single p-n junction with a band gap of 1.34 eV, AM 1.5 solar spectrum).  This limit arises from the fact that red and near-infrared (NIR) part of solar spectrum possess too low energy to cause electrons and holes formation in a semiconductor material. Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is the only known physical phenomenon that allows to overcome SQ limit. It can be achieved if upconversion material, transforming light of lower energy into light of higher energy (e.g. red into blue), is placed underneath the cell along with a reflector as shown in the figure below.
