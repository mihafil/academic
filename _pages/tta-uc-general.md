Photon upconversion (UC) is a process in which light of long wavelength is converted to photons of higher energy, e.g. red into yellow light conversion. Photon upconversion via the mechanism of triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) can be performed with high efficiency (up to 50%). As illustrated in figure below, a typical TTA-UC system combines two components: a sensitizer and an emitter, undergoing a series of energy transfer processes. Absorption of light by the sensitizer leads to formation of its triplet excited state (T<sub>1</sub>) via the process of intersystem crossing (ISC). Further, this state transfers its energy to the emitter molecule (triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET)). Next, the excited triplet states of two emitter molecules undergo triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA), in which one emitter molecule returns back to its singlet ground state and the other molecule gains the energy of both triplet states and is excited to a higher energy singlet state (S<sub>1</sub>). As the singlet state of the emitter decays radiatively back to the ground state, a fluorescence photon is emitted which is strongly blue-shifted compared to the excitation photons.

Due this unique feature, in recent years TTA-UC has found various applications such as photocatalysis, bioimaging, photomedicine and [solar energy conversion](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pagess/solar-cells-general).

<strong>My research in this field concerns three particular aspects:</strong>

* design and synthesis of advanced sensitizer and emitter molecules for maximizing the efficiency of TTA-UC 
* upconversion of near-infrared light (700-900 nm) into visible light using pi-extended porphyrins and related dyes
* protection of TTA-UC materials from quenching and oxidation by molecular oxygen
