Photoinduced electron transfer in the excited state is a common phenomenon, observed for dye molecules containing electron-donor and acceptor groups. Electronic structure of such molecules provides a possibility that after light absorption the electron is transferred from the donor unit to the acceptor, which creates a highly dipolar excited state - charge-transfer (CT) state.
