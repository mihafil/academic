<strong>TU Dublin Students: Research Projects</strong>

I normally supervise two 4th year (DT299) and two 3rd year (DT261) project students  per year. For projects starting in March, the work plan is made available in November. You are strongly encouraged to come and chat before submitting your project choices if you are interested in working with me.

<strong>Visiting Students</strong>

Opportunities for short-term placements (e.g. for Erasmus students) may be available, although please note that I cannot guarantee funding for such visits. If you are able to apply for funding yourself, please contact me well in advance of the closing date with details of the envisaged funding scheme.
