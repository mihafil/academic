**1. Long-term stable composition, such as phosphorescent composition or TTA-photon upconversion composition.**

EP 2 851 407 A1, US 2016/0222286 A1, WO 2015/044129 A1, 2015

As part of my postdoctoral research at Max Planck Institute, my collegues and I created a technology for the protection of 
photoactive materials form oxygen quenching and oxidation. In a near future it will yield more efficient and long-living 
photonic devices for solar energy harvesting and conversion.
