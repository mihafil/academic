EP 2 851 407 A1, [US 2016/0222286 A1](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20160222286.pdf), WO 2015/044129 A1

As part of my postdoctoral research at Max Planck Institute, my collegues and I created a technology for the protection of 
photoactive materials form oxygen quenching and oxidation. In a near future it will yield more efficient and long-living 
photonic devices for solar energy harvesting and conversion. 

**2. Method of Synthesis of 5,5'-Disubstituted Ï€-extended Dipyrromethenes and Their Use as Analytical Reagents for Metal Ions and Fluorescent Imaging Probes**

[US 2011/0144351 A1](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20110144351.pdf)

During my work at the Moscow State University in collaboration with Prof. Sergei Vinogradov (University of Pennsylvania), we developed a new type molecular probes which enable fluorescence imaging of metal ions in vivo. This class of compounds is currently under active development internationally in several research labs.


**3. Method of Reduction of Unsaturated Ketones into Saturated Ketones.**

[RU 2 293 720 C1](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/files/PatentRU-2007.pdf)

This invention describes an environmentally-safe industrial technology for unsaturated ketones reduction. It enables to avoid use of highly toxic and dangerous liquid ammonia as a solvent. Application of this technology in our spin-off project allowed to reduce chemical hazards and costs of the production.


**4. Method of Synthesis of 24-Epibrassinolide.**

[RU 2 272 044 C1](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/files/PatentRU-2006.pdf)

My collegues and I developed a technology for large-scale production of 24-epibrassinolide, a natural phytohormone responsible for plant protection against environmental stress.
