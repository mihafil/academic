Hello and welcome to my website!

I am a lecturer in the School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences at TU Dublin. I  received my MSc and PhD degree from Moscow State University and conducted postdoctoral projects in the University of Burgundy and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, investigating new functional dyes for photonic applications. Later I was awarded Marie Curie Individual Fellowship and moved to Ireland, starting a research project in the field of photomedicine at Trinity College Dublin. After completing this project in 2017 I joined TU Dublin as a faculty member.

I am organic chemist by training, with particular interest in synthesis and photochemistry. Read more about my research projects [here](https://mihafil.github.io/academic//research/).
