Hello and welcome to my website!

I am an organic chemist by training, with particular interest in multistep synthesis and photochemistry. My current research is focused on functional dyes and photoactive materials with programmed optical properties. Together with my group members, I am investigating porphyrins, dipyrrins, BODIPYs and related pyrrolic dyes for applications in photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy and triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion. Read more about my research projects [here](https://mihafil.github.io/academic//research/).
