I am organic chemist by training, with particular interest in synthesis and photochemistry. My research is devoted to the development of photoactive compounds and light-harvesting materials for energy applications and healthcare. 

I received my MSc and PhD degree from Moscow State University and conducted postdoctoral projects in the University of Burgundy and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, investigating new functional dyes for photonic applications. Later I was awarded Marie Curie Individual Fellowship and moved to Ireland, starting a research project in the field of photomedicine at Trinity College Dublin. I joined TU Dublin as a faculty member in 2017.
