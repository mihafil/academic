I received my PhD degree in the field of organic chemistry from Moscow State University in 2008. I have conducted postdoctoral research in the University of Burgundy and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. In 2015 I obtained Marie Curie Individual Fellowship to perform a two-year research project at Trinity College Dublin. I joined TU Dublin a faculty member in 2017. My current research spans the areas of multistep organic synthesis, photochemistry, spectroscopy and the development of light-harvesting materials for energy applications and healthcare.
