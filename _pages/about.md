Hello and welcome to my website!

Iâ€™m an organic chemist with a passion for exploring the intricate world of multistep synthesis and photochemistry. My research focuses on designing functional dyes and photoactive materials with finely tuned optical properties. Alongside my group members, we explore the chemistry and optical properties of porphyrins, dipyrrins, BODIPYs, and related heterocyclic dyes, unlocking their potential for state-of-the-art applications in photocatalysis, photodynamic therapy, and triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion.
