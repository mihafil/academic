Hello and welcome to my website!

I am organic chemist by training, with particular interest in synthesis and photochemistry. Read more about my [research projects](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/research).

I received my MSc and PhD degree from Moscow State University and conducted postdoctoral projects in the University of Burgundy and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, investigating new functional dyes for photonic applications. Later I was awarded Marie Curie Individual Fellowship and moved to Ireland, starting a research project in the field of photomedicine at Trinity College Dublin. I joined TU Dublin as a faculty member in 2017.
