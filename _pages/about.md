Hello and welcome to my website!

Iâ€™m an organic chemist with a passion for exploring the intricate world of multistep synthesis and photochemistry. My research focuses on creation of new functional dyes and organic materials with tailored optical properties. For an overview of my professional journey, see my CV [here](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/files/Filatov-CV-June-2025_SHORT.pdf) 

Alongside my group members, we explore the chemistry and properties of porphyrins, dipyrrins, BODIPYs, and related heterocyclic dyes, unlocking their potential for state-of-the-art applications in biophotonics, photocatalysis and energy conversion. Curious to learn more? Check out our research projects [here](https://mihafil.github.io/academic//research/).
