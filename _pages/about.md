I am organic chemist by training with a background in synthesis and photochemistry. My research is devoted to the development of photoactive compounds and light-harvesting materials for energy applications and healthcare. 

After obtaining PhD degree from Moscow State University I conducted postdoctoral research in the University of Burgundy and Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. Later I obtained Marie Curie Individual Fellowship and moved to Ireland, undertaking a project at Trinity College Dublin. I joined TU Dublin a faculty member in 2017.
