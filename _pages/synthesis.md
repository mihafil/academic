Porphyrins with extended π-systems
======
The fusion of aromatic rings to porphyrin core has a strong influence on electronic properties, particularly reducing HOMO−LUMO gap and shifting the absorption and emission into near-infrared (NIR) region. 
Because of these properties, such molecules are attractive for numerous applications, such as NIR photodetectors, photovoltaics, semiconductors, and two-photon absorbing materials. 
Unlike other porphyrins with extended conjugated π-system, they possess very sharp absorption bands and an optical window between Soret and Q-bands, allowing for their application as photosensitizers in [triplet-triplet annihilation photon upconversion](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/tta-uc-general).
