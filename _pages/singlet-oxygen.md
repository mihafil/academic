Singlet oxygen is an electronically excited state of molecular oxygen which is less stable than ground state (triplet) oxygen. 
Typically generated via energy transfer from the triplet excited state of a photosensitizer to the oxygen molecule. 
Singlet oxygen is highly reactive and is used, for example, to destroy cancer cells in photodynamic therapy. 
In my research, I design and study advanced photosensitizer molecules capable of controlled generation or singlet oxygen. 
In particular, I am developing molecular systems capable of generating, binding and releasing singlet oxygen molecules. 
An example of such system – tetrabenzoporphyrin with appended anthracene groups is shown below. 
When irradiated with a laser or kept under daylight in air-saturated solution, this compound forms corresponding endoperoxide – 
a product of [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between singlet oxygen and anthracene. 
Release of bound oxygen molecules can be achieved upon heating.
