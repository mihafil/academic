Photoinduced electron transfer in the excited state is a common phenomenon, observed for dye molecules containing electron-donor and acceptor groups. Electronic structure of such molecules provides a possibility that after light absorption the electron is transferred from the donor unit to the acceptor, which creates a highly dipolar excited state - charge-transfer (CT) state.

Recombination of CT states (CR) can result in the formation of a local triplet excited state with high yields via the so-called spin-orbit charge-transfer (SOCT-ISC) mechanism:

Notably, SOCT-ISC mechanism does not require introduction of transition metals or other heavy atoms into the molecule. Triplet sensitizers operating via SOCT-ISC are highly advantageous due to the following reasons: 1) they are cheaper and easier to prepare compared common sensitizers, such as transition metal complexes and halogenated dyes; 2) they are non-toxic and environmentally friendly; 3) they possess intense absorption the visible region (400-600 nm). Application of these molecules in photocatalysis, triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently a subject of active investigations.

Along with collaborators we studying and optimizing SOCT-ISC in donor-acceptor dyads: fluorescence and ISC rates, sensitivity of charge transfer towards environmental parameters (polarity, viscosity, magnetic field, presence of metal ions), absorption in spectral region of interest (500-800 nm) and performance in TTA-UC.
