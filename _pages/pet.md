Photoinduced electron transfer
======

Photoinduced electron transfer in the excited state is a common phenomenon, observed for dye molecules containing electron-donor and acceptor groups. Electronic structure of such molecules provides a possibility that after light absorption the electron is transferred from the donor unit to the acceptor, which creates a highly dipolar excited state, referred to as charge-transfer (CT) state.

 It has been noted in numerous works, that CT state recombination may result in the formation of a local triplet excited state, which further decays to the ground state either via phosphorescence or non-radiative decay processes.  For instance, the generation of triplet excited states in heavy-atom–free donor−acceptor perylene bisimides dimers and dyads has been studied in details. In these systems the triplet excited states were found to be generated via so-called spin-orbit charge-transfer (SOCT-ISC) mechanisms from the CT state.
The scope of such compounds is very broad: the system can be based on common fluorescent molecules, chemically modified to cause the required charge transfer couplings. For instance, simple aromatic systems, such anthracenes or xantene derivatives can be used as model compounds. In this project I am particularly focus on BODIPY fluorophores as building blocks for modular studies of target systems.
