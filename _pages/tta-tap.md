Palladium and platinum complexes of tetraaryltetraanthraporphyrins developed by us enable the energetically-conjoined TTA-UC 
process with rubrene as an emitter, when excited with NIR light (800 nm), at ultralow light intensity of <100 mWcm<sub>-2</sub>.

TAP sensitizers are able of TTET to a single emitter species (rubrene). A mixture of sensitizers with various absorption maxima 
was used by us so that to expand the total width of the excitation spectra for upconversion.  
Adjustment of the concentration of PdTAPs 1-3 in the mixture to a ratio, corresponding to the investigated optimal conditions, 
delivered the system with absorption spanning 720-840 nm region. Broadband excitation in this region with emulated moderately 
concentrated sunlight (integral intensity ~ 50 mWcm-2) resulted in efficient (>3 % Q.Y.) upconversion emission. 
Functioning UC-devices prepared and sealed in argon-filled glove-box is shown in figure below. Using viscous organic solvent, 
instead of volatile one, ensured long lifetime of the UC-device. Such devices were found to operate in a stable manner, 
without noticeable performance degradation, for several months even if placed under water.
