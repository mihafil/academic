In recent years, organic photochemistry research attracted special attention due to the great promise it offers in the
context of solar energy utilization. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to develop an efficient artificial photosynthesis
process. Solving this challenging problem will affect the whole mankind and will radically improve the quality of life
worldwide.
Materials which efficiently form triplet excited states upon light absorption are of crucial importance for this technology.
A key property of the triplet states is their long lifetimes, which can reach the timescale of seconds. Due to this
property, triplet states can mediate chemical reactions by transferring energy to other molecules. This allows for
efficient harvesting of light energy and its conversion into useful chemicals or electricity.
Currently, materials forming long-living triplet states are prepared from transition metal complexes and organic dyes
containing halogen atoms. For this reason they are often incredibly expensive and toxic. My research programme is aimed to develop a
new generation of light-harvesting materials based on heavy-atom-free photoactive molecules, which efficiently
generate triplet excited states. On a large scale, these materials are expected to find more economical applications as
for transition metal- and halogen-based ones.
We are investigating photoactive boron dipyrromethenes, synthetic analogues of natural pigments, to optimize
their photophysical and chemical properties. We use chemical modification to imprint desirable molecular properties
into individual molecules to allow for optimized performance. Based on these molecules, we develop new hybrid 
materials with unique properties for antibacterial coatings and light harvesting films.
