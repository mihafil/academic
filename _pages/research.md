My research combines organic chemistry and photophysics and is targeted on the development of multichromophoric molecules and materials with programmed optical properties. I am investigating porphyrins, dipyrrins and BODIPY dyes to understand how the excited state transitions in these molecules can be controlled by the structural factors and the environment. In particular, I am focused on applications of these systems in [photodynamic therapy](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/pdt-general), [triplet-triplet annihilation photon upconversion](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/tta-uc-general) and photocatalysis. I remain interested in industrial R&D and corporate engagement with science and technology more broadly.

My current research activities can be divided into three interconnected projects:

* [Synthesis of multichromophoric systems](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/synthesis)
* [Generation, sensing and reactivity of singlet oxygen](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/singlet-oxygen)
* [Photoinduced electron transfer and intersystem crossing in donor-acceptor dyads](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/pet)
