My research lies on the frontier of organic chemistry and photophysics and is targeted on the development of multichromophoric molecules with programmed optical properties. I am investigating porphyrins, dipyrrins and BODIPY dyes â€“ analogues of natural photosynthetic pigments. In particular I am focused on applications of these systems in biomedicine (photodynamic therapy) and energy conversion ([triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/research/TTA-UC-general)). I remain interested in industrial R&D and corporate engagement with science and technology more broadly.

My current research activities can be divided into three interconnected projects:

* Synthesis of multichromophoric systems
* Generation, sensing and reactivity of singlet oxygen
* Photoinduced electron transfer and intersystem crossing in donor-acceptor dyads
