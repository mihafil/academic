My research combines organic chemistry and photophysics and is targeted on the development of multichromophoric molecules and optical materials with programmed properties. I am particularly interested in application of these new systems in [photoactive drugs](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/pdt-general), [triplet-triplet annihilation photon upconversion](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/tta-uc-general) and photocatalysis. Additionally, I have a strong interest in industrial R&D and corporate collaboration, bridging science and technology for innovative advancements.

My current research activities can be divided into three interconnected projects:

* Synthesis of multichromophoric systems [(read more)](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/synthesis)
* Generation and sensing of singlet oxygen [(read more)](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/singlet-oxygen)
* Photoinduced electron transfer and intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) in donor-acceptor dyads [(read more)](https://mihafil.github.io/academic/pages/pet)
